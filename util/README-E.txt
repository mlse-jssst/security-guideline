How to Use:

  1. Please open the tab of the sheet of "I. Specification of AI system" of the risk assessment tool and proceed according to the instruction of the sheet. At first please fill AI system specification to the columns of specifications. At second, please investigate potential attackers (PAs) in the Sheet I. After that, please choice a PA from the investigated PAs. 
  2. Please answer the Yes/No questions in the sheet of "II. Questionnaire" form the consideration of the role/capability of the PA. After that, please fill the reason for your answer to the columns of reasons. The sheet of "III. Reference.Examples" may be helpful in answering the questions. 
  3. When you complete the answering, which attack algorithms can be applied by the chosen PA are outputted in the sheet of "IV. Result of Assessment". In addition, detailed evaluation results include attack trees for all assumed attack algorithms are outputted to the sheet of each attack method. For example, if the PA is "a user" of the AI system, which attacks are actually applicable when the user of the AI system performs the assumed attacks is determined. If the PA is "an administrator" of the AI system, whether assumed attacks are applicable by an insider is determined. If you determine that you want to prevent an attack from a PA, consider the conditions for unsatisfying the attack tree on the sheet of each attack method, and change the AI system specifications based on the example of response plans in the sheet of "V. Countermeasures". If no countermeasures can be taken, it is possible to prevent attacks by implementing measures dedicated to AI security. In that case, consult an AI security expert.
  4. Please substitute another person to the PA, and answer the yes/no questions in the sheet of "II. Questionnaire" and fill the reasons of your answer. Please repeat answering until all investigated person are substituted the PA and answering the yes/no questions for each substituted PA. Finally, all investigated person are substituted to the PA, and assessment results namely which attack algorithms are applicable or not are outputted for all investigated person.
